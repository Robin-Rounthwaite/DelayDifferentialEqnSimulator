# CSV Specification
#   Ignored by the file readers are:
#     (1) blank rows and all other whitespace
#     (2) comment rows which always begin with a '#'
#     (3) blank cells such as "A, B, , C, D"
#     (4) any cell that does not begin with a numerical or decimal place character*
#   *Such cells act as column headers. These are provided for the user's convenience and can be modified as the user sees fit.
#   It is futile to add/remove/modify the column headers with the expectation of changing the program's behavior. Data must be entered in the order specified by the generated column headers if the simulation is to interpret the data properly.
# IMPORTANT: Rename this file to "param_list.csv" or similar once data has been entered!
