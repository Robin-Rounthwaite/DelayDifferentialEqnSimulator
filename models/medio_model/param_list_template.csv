# CSV Specification
#   Ignored by the file readers are:
#     (1) blank rows and all other whitespace
#     (2) comment rows which always begin with a '#'
#     (3) blank cells such as "A,B,,C,D"
#     (4) any cell that does not begin with a numerical or decimal place character*
#   *Such cells act as either column headers or other important notes. These are provided for the user's convenience and can be modified as the user sees fit.
#   It is futile to add/remove/modify the column headers with the expectation of changing the program's behavior. Data must be entered in the default order or must match the ordering of a respective command line argument.
# IMPORTANT: Rename this file to "param_list.csv" or similar once data has been entered!
