# IMPORTANT: Rename this file to "param_list.csv" once data has been entered!
#
# CSV Specification
#   Ignored by the simulation file reader are:
#     (1) blank rows and all other whitespace
#     (2) rows beginning with '#' -- these act as comments
#     (3) blank cells such as "A, B, , D, E"
#     (4) the first non-comment, non-blank row in the file*
#   *The cells of the first non-comment, non-blank row are column headers. These are provided for the user's convenience.
#   It is futile to modify the order of the column headers. Data must be entered in the order specified by the generated column headers in order for the simulation to work properly.
